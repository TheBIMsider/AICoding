# Learn to code with AI

A repository for my adventures with the free [scrimba](https://scrimba.com) online course [Learning to code with AI](https://scrimba.com/learn/aicoding)

In this course you build interactive, database-powered projects while learning how to write effective prompts and debug and refine your code with the help of AI. No coding experience needed!

I will store my projects from the 3 phases of this course below üëá
